# Google_Ads__Campaign-Tracking--Template-checker
A short JavaScript Google Ads script that can easily help you check the tracking template that is set up in each campaign of your Ad Account.

There is also an additional script that can be set up on MCC level and iterate all campaigns in all your ad accounts that meet certain conditions (here for ad accounts that have Impressions > 0 for the LAST_30_DAYS).

The third script in the repository, MCC Campaign Tracking Template applier, on the other hand helps you apply a tracking template to all campaigns of the iterated ad accounts of the MCC.

ðŸš¸ This script is not maintained, so, in time, certain operations or even the entire script may not be functional.
